# Installing
Can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/RoloEdits/tog-discord-bingo/releases) page. No need to install, and generally recoomended to move the executable to the top level folder that the bingo excel files are being stored in.

A requirement for image output to work is that [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) must be installed.

# Using

The use is centered around `xlsx` excel files. Upon opening the program you will see an area to drag-and-drop the file onto:

The colors can be preserved by standard copy-paste from discord. No need to change any color manually, you will get expeceted results in the output:
